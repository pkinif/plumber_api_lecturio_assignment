Instructions

Data to be used for the project are in the SQLite DB. Data provide information on how much (watched_seconds) users watched different lectures (=short videos) as well as which group a user belongs to.

Task: Write an API endpoint that returns the sum of watched hours per group and per year or per month. 
We want to choose which groups should be included, by handing over group_ids as query parameter (default = all groups included).
We also want to choose whether returning the sum per year or per month.
If a group did not watch anything during a year/month, value should be 0.

The output should include the year and month (depending on the summarising unit), the group name(s) and the hours watched. It should be returned as a json.


You are provided with an R project that makes use of renv for control of R version and packages.
It should be set up automatically when you open the project for the first time, i.e. a library with the necessary packages will be created in the renv directory. 
The R packages included should be sufficient for this assessment.
The structure of the R project mimics our API project structure. You should add your code to the files APIs/api1/api1.R and APIs/api1/endpoint1.R accordingly, function definitions can go into the R directory (APIs/R). 
The API should run locally in swagger by running the code in the main file (main.R). At the moment it should return "status code: 200" when successful, after you added your code it should return the results.
